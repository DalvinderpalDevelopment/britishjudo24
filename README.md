## Project Outcome

### What went well?

- Using CSS Flexbox to build out the section helped considerably, especialkly when aligning elements on the page.
- Using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention which helped me create orgnaised, reusable code and was was really useful when styling elements and components in scss.

### What did not go well?

- Adding video to hero section, impacted page speed/performance and had to compress file to make sure page speed was too impacted.
- Stat counter on page was not as efficient, also impacted page speed/performance, could maybe use a external library to handle animation.
- While mobile view of landing page is adequate, could do with a focus on mobile first, making sure elements/components look good on mobile, adhere to mobile first approach.
